# Elden-Ring-Level-Calculator
Elden Ring Calculator to determine runes to get to desired level
Input current level must be 12 or higher. Then choose desired level. Elden Ring levels go up to 713 at max.
Last input is the amount of runes that you recieve on a farm route per kill.
You can also set your file path in the GUI2GitHub file to save your data to your pc everytime you run the calculator.
I would like to make this a full build planner in the future, so if anyone would like to help feel free to message me!
